=========================================================================================================

Company Information:
-------------------
Company Name: Velome Private Limited (with Velome Global Australia)
Founded: 2025
Headquarters/Registered Office: 5F-507 Precision Soho, Tower Sec 67, Badshahpur, Sohna, Gurgaon, Haryana, India, 122103

Company History & Founding:
---------------------------
Velome was founded in 2025 by a diverse team of travel enthusiasts, storytellers, marketers, and technology experts. The company emerged from a common pain point experienced by international travelers - the frustration of expensive international roaming fees, unreliable WiFi connectivity, and the time-consuming process of purchasing local SIM cards at airport kiosks upon arrival.

The founding team brings together 35+ years of combined professional experience across multiple critical domains:
- Travel technology and innovation
- Telecommunications infrastructure and services
- Cybersecurity and data protection
- Digital marketing and customer engagement

This diverse expertise allows Velome to address the connectivity needs of modern travelers while maintaining enterprise-grade security and reliability standards.

Mission Statement:
------------------
"To provide seamless connectivity that keeps every journey effortless and worry-free, while contributing positively to the planet and the communities travelers touch."

Additional mission commitment: A portion of Velome's earnings is dedicated to supporting social and environmental initiatives that benefit the communities and environments where travelers visit.

Vision Statement:
-----------------
"To be the trusted travel companion worldwide, empowering journeys where users roam freely, stay connected everywhere, and explore confidently, enjoying every moment of discovery while creating positive experiences for the people and places they encounter along the way."

Core Values & Principles:
-------------------------

   - Providing secure, encrypted data transmission
   - Maintaining transparent communication and fair business practices

   - Creating positive environmental change through digital solutions (reducing physical SIM card waste)
   - Supporting communities through social initiatives
   - Making global connectivity accessible and affordable
   - Leaving a positive footprint with every traveler journey

Organizational Structure:

- Velome Global Australia: Manages international operations and global expansion

Both entities operate under unified brand values and service standards.

What is an eSIM?

SECTION 4: PRICING & PLANS
=========================================================================================================

Pricing Overview:
-----------------

Velome uses a transparent, simple pricing model based on:
1. Destination country/region
2. Number of travel days
3. Number of eSIMs required

No hidden fees, no surprise charges - pricing is upfront and all-inclusive (except local taxes).

Pricing Structure:
------------------

BASE PRICING (Per Destination, Per Day):
Common Rate: ₹250 per day for unlimited data

Examples by Destination:
- Vietnam: ₹250/day
- Japan: ₹250/day
- Thailand: ₹250/day (expected)
- South Korea: ₹250/day (expected)
- Italy: ₹250/day (expected)
- UAE: ₹250/day (expected)

Note: Prices are consistent across many destinations; some premium destinations may vary slightly.

Price Calculation Formula:
------------------------

Total Cost = (Base Daily Rate × Number of Days × Number of eSIMs) + Applicable Taxes

Example Calculation:
Destination: Vietnam
Number of Days: 5
Number of eSIMs: 1
Daily Rate: ₹250

Calculation:
₹250 × 5 days × 1 eSIM = ₹1,250 (Subtotal)
Add Taxes (typically 5-18%): ~₹150-225
Total with Tax: ~₹1,400-1,475

Price Customization Options:
----------------------------

1. NUMBER OF DAYS
   - Flexible selection from 1 day onwards
   - No upper limit on days
   - Can extend for longer trips
   - Price scales linearly with days
   - Examples:
     * 1 day: ₹250
     * 7 days: ₹1,750
     * 14 days: ₹3,500
     * 30 days: ₹7,500

2. NUMBER OF eSIMS
   - Purchase multiple for different devices
   - Family and group travel packages
   - Each eSIM charged separately
   - Example (2 eSIMs for 5 days):
     * ₹250 × 5 × 2 = ₹2,500

3. MULTI-DESTINATION TRIPS
   - Purchase separate eSIMs for each destination
   - Regional packages (e.g., Oceania, Europe)
   - Global plans available
   - Switch eSIMs as you move between countries

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - COMPLETE WITH ANSWERS
​
HOW TO USE AN eSIM
1. Do the plans include voice calls and SMS?
All our plans are unlimited data plans, hence none of them come with Traditional Voice Call's or SMS services, BUT you can always use VoIP services like Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc to make calls or send messages and always be connected.
​

2. Can I run two eSims on the same phone at the same time?
That really depends on the device you have. While many smartphones let you store several eSim profiles, most of them only let one be active at a given moment. But if you have a Physical SIM, then you can run one Physical SIM and one eSim at the same time on all eSim compatible phones.

And, some phones do support the usage of two eSim's at the same time, a few of them are as follows:

Apple:

iPhone 13 and newer – All models (iPhone 13, 14, 15 series) support Dual SIM with two eSims

iPhone 14 and newer – In addition to a physical SIM, you can have two active eSims

Samsung:

Galaxy S series – Galaxy S22, S23, S24, S25 all support dual active eSims

Galaxy Z Fold & Flip series – Models such as Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5 support dual active eSims

Galaxy A series – The Galaxy A54 5G and A55 5G include this capability

Google Pixel:

Pixel 7 and newer – Pixel 7, 7 Pro, 8, 8 Pro, 9, 9 Pro all support dual active eSims

Pixel Fold – The Google Pixel Fold also supports dual active eSims

Note: Some U.S. variants are eSim-only, while international versions often have a hybrid (eSim + physical SIM)

Motorola:

The Motorola Edge 40 5G Dual-SIM offers dual SIM support with eSim capability

Other manufacturers:

Keep an eye on newer flagships from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, etc.; many now include dual active eSim support

GETTING AN eSIM
1. Will my eSim expire if I don't activate it right after buying it?

​

SETUP & ACTIVATION

​

QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

Restart your phone

Check if Data Roaming is enabled for your Velome eSIM

Turn airplane mode on and off

Check your eSIM is set as the active data SIM

Contact Velome support if issues persist at support@velome.travel
​

2. I'm seeing the "This code is no longer valid" error. What should I do?
This typically means the QR code has already been used or expired. Contact Velome support at support@velome.travel with proof of purchase to get a new QR code.
​

3. I lost my eSim QR code. How can I retrieve it?
Contact Velome support immediately at support@velome.travel with your order details. They can resend the QR code or provide an alternative activation method.
​

4. My plan says "unlimited data," yet I'm hitting speed limits. Why?
Velome may implement a Fair Use Policy where speeds are temporarily reduced to 3G during peak usage, while maintaining unlimited data. Speeds reset to 4G/5G the next day.
​

5. Why does my network feel slower than it should?
Possible causes:

Network congestion in your location

Fair Use Policy in effect (temporary speed reduction)

Poor signal strength

Device or app issues

Local carrier network issues
Contact support if persists.
​

6. How do I set the correct APN so my eSim stays connected?
For most networks, APN settings are automatic. If manual setup is needed, contact Velome support with your destination country - they'll provide the correct APN settings.
​

7. Why can't I use my iPhone as a hotspot with the eSim?
This may be a limitation with your carrier or device settings. Ensure:

Data Roaming is enabled for the eSIM

Hotspot feature is enabled in Settings

You have active data
Contact Velome support if issues persist.
​

8. Where can I find my phone's EID and IMEI?
iPhone: Settings → About → look for EID

VELOME WEBSITE - COMPLETE & EXHAUSTIVE SCRAPE WITH FAQ ANSWERS
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - COMPLETE WITH ANSWERS
​
HOW TO USE AN eSIM
1. Do the plans include voice calls and SMS?
All our plans are unlimited data plans, hence none of them come with Traditional Voice Call's or SMS services, BUT you can always use VoIP services like Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc to make calls or send messages and always be connected.
​

2. Can I run two eSims on the same phone at the same time?
That really depends on the device you have. While many smartphones let you store several eSim profiles, most of them only let one be active at a given moment. But if you have a Physical SIM, then you can run one Physical SIM and one eSim at the same time on all eSim compatible phones.

And, some phones do support the usage of two eSim's at the same time, a few of them are as follows:

Apple:

iPhone 13 and newer – All models (iPhone 13, 14, 15 series) support Dual SIM with two eSims

iPhone 14 and newer – In addition to a physical SIM, you can have two active eSims

Samsung:

Galaxy S series – Galaxy S22, S23, S24, S25 all support dual active eSims

Galaxy Z Fold & Flip series – Models such as Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5 support dual active eSims

Galaxy A series – The Galaxy A54 5G and A55 5G include this capability

Google Pixel:

Pixel 7 and newer – Pixel 7, 7 Pro, 8, 8 Pro, 9, 9 Pro all support dual active eSims

Pixel Fold – The Google Pixel Fold also supports dual active eSims

Note: Some U.S. variants are eSim-only, while international versions often have a hybrid (eSim + physical SIM)

Motorola:

The Motorola Edge 40 5G Dual-SIM offers dual SIM support with eSim capability

Other manufacturers:

Keep an eye on newer flagships from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, etc.; many now include dual active eSim support
​

3. Can I have several phones scan the same QR code?
[Expanded answer pending - requires clicking to view]

4. Do I need to turn on Data Roaming when I'm using Velome's eSim?
[Expanded answer pending - requires clicking to view]

5. Will my regular (physical) SIM keep working after I install an eSim?
Yes, your physical SIM will continue to work. You can have both active simultaneously - your physical SIM for calls/SMS and Velome eSim for data.
​

6. When does my Velome eSim data plan actually start?
Your data plan starts upon activation of the eSIM on your device. You can activate before or after landing at your destination.
​

7. What if I lose my phone? Can I move my eSim to a new device?
Yes, you can contact Velome support to move your eSIM to a new device. eSIMs are digital profiles that can be reinstalled on compatible devices.
​

8. What's the easiest way to view my eSim data balance and related details?
You can view your eSIM data balance through your device's settings menu under Cellular/Mobile data settings, or contact Velome support for assistance.
​

9. Can I renew or add more data to my eSim?
Yes, you can renew or extend your plan duration upon request. Contact Velome support at support@velome.travel for renewal options.
​

10. Do I need to delete my Velome eSim once I'm done with it?
No, you don't need to delete it. The eSIM will automatically expire after your plan validity ends.
​

COMPATIBILITY OF DEVICES
1. Which devices work with eSim?
Most modern smartphones support eSIM, including iPhones (XS and newer), Samsung Galaxy (S20 and newer), Google Pixel (3 and newer), and many others. Check Velome's device compatibility list for specific models.
​

2. Can I put an eSim in my laptop?
Some newer laptops support eSIM functionality, but this depends on the specific model. Most traditional laptops do not support eSIM. Check your device manual.
​

3. Why can't I install an eSim on a phone that is compatible?
Possible reasons include: phone not being network-unlocked, insufficient storage, account lock issues, or carrier restrictions. Try restarting your phone, checking for software updates, or contacting Velome support.
​

4. Which phone models work with eSim?
See Velome's Supported Devices page for a comprehensive list updated regularly, including: iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, OnePlus, Motorola, Oppo, Xiaomi, and many others.
​

GETTING AN eSIM
1. Will my eSim expire if I don't activate it right after buying it?
No, your eSIM will not expire immediately. You have time to activate it. However, check the validity period mentioned at purchase - eSIMs should ideally be activated within a reasonable timeframe.
​

2. How soon will I get my eSim after I pay?
You'll receive your eSIM via email within 2 hours of payment. The QR code will be sent to your registered email address.
​

3. Can I get an eSim that works in more than one country?
Yes! Velome offers multi-country regional plans like Europe, Asia, Middle East, Latin America, North America, Oceania, and a Global plan that works in 200+ destinations.
​

4. Can I use WhatsApp or Instagram with my Velome eSim?
Yes, absolutely! Since Velome provides data connectivity, you can use all internet-based apps including WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Facebook, etc.
​

SETUP & ACTIVATION
1. When's the best time to install my eSim?
You can install your eSIM before you travel (recommended - do it on WiFi at home) or after you land. Installing before travel is ideal as it requires WiFi/data connection.
​

2. How do I set up Velome eSim on my device?
iPhone/iOS:

Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM

Scan the QR code from your email

Follow the installation prompts

Label your eSIM (e.g., "Velome Thailand")

Set as Primary for calls/SMS, and as cellular data line for internet

Enable Data Roaming for the Velome eSIM only

Tap Done to complete

Android:

Settings → Connections → SIM Manager

Tap Add eSIM

Scan QR code

Follow prompts to complete installation
​

QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING
1. What's the quickest way to get my eSim working again?

Restart your phone

Check if Data Roaming is enabled for your Velome eSIM

Turn airplane mode on and off

Check your eSIM is set as the active data SIM

Contact Velome support if issues persist at support@velome.travel
​

2. I'm seeing the "This code is no longer valid" error. What should I do?
This typically means the QR code has already been used or expired. Contact Velome support at support@velome.travel with proof of purchase to get a new QR code.
​

3. I lost my eSim QR code. How can I retrieve it?
Contact Velome support immediately at support@velome.travel with your order details. They can resend the QR code or provide an alternative activation method.
​

4. My plan says "unlimited data," yet I'm hitting speed limits. Why?
Velome may implement a Fair Use Policy where speeds are temporarily reduced to 3G during peak usage, while maintaining unlimited data. Speeds reset to 4G/5G the next day.
​

5. Why does my network feel slower than it should?
Possible causes:

Network congestion in your location

Fair Use Policy in effect (temporary speed reduction)

Poor signal strength

Device or app issues

Local carrier network issues
Contact support if persists.
​

6. How do I set the correct APN so my eSim stays connected?
For most networks, APN settings are automatic. If manual setup is needed, contact Velome support with your destination country - they'll provide the correct APN settings.
​

7. Why can't I use my iPhone as a hotspot with the eSim?
This may be a limitation with your carrier or device settings. Ensure:

Data Roaming is enabled for the eSIM

Hotspot feature is enabled in Settings

You have active data
Contact Velome support if issues persist.
​

8. Where can I find my phone's EID and IMEI?
iPhone: Settings → About → look for EID
Android: Settings → About Phone → look for IMEI/EID or dial *#06#
All phones: Dial *#06# on your keypad to display EID
​
